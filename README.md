### Sophie Shears
***
Hi I'm Sophie, I worked for different federal agencies for the last 5 years doing wildlife work, but slowly
transitioned to doing more programming and GIS work. My most recent positions have been focused mostly on
programming and GIS and I have taken 3 months off to focus solely on improving my skills as a programmer
at the [Recurse Center](recurse.com). Looking to being able to focus primarily on programming at my next position.
